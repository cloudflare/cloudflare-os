 * member's: no members, no new workspace, no change of address.
 *
 * Both the list and the tree show only the entries visible to everyone signed in, those
 * published with no unpublished entry above them, whatever the listing holds: one read while the
 * user was still a member has the space's other workspaces too.
 *
