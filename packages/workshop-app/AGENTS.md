# Workshop App

The reworked Workshop frontend, built beside `workshop-frontend` (which stays the shipped app until
cutover). Scope is deliberately small: chat, chat settings, and the Library and Workspaces pages.
Follow `../../AGENTS.md` and the `frontend-conventions` skill in addition to this file.

Dev server: `pnpm --filter @gadgets/workshop-app dev` (port 3001; the old frontend uses 3000).
`src/routeTree.gen.ts` is generated and committed, like the old app's; do not edit it.

## Layers

```text
src/
  components/   Kumo wrappers and primitives; no product knowledge, no data
  blocks/       Compositions of components for one purpose (a message, a composer, a list row)
  layouts/      Page structure: shell, sidebar, aside, toolbar pages. Arrange slots, know no content
  routes/       Route declarations; they connect the data folders below to the UI layers above

  rpc/          The backend connection and sign-in; `useApi()` beneath `RpcGate`
  workspaces/   The user's workspace list
  chat/         A conversation: `ChatSession` (plain class, no React), the mapping from server
                messages to what is rendered, and `ChatPane`, which wires them to the UI blocks
```

UI imports point down only: components, then blocks, then layouts, then routes. The data folders
(`rpc/`, `workspaces/`, `chat/`) are the only code that talks to the backend: UI layers cannot import
them, and they cannot import routes. Lint enforces both (`vite.config.ts` at the repo root). Blocks
and layouts take plain typed props and callbacks.

Put protocol logic in plain classes and functions with no React (like `ChatSession`), so it can be
tested without rendering. `pnpm --filter @gadgets/workshop-app test:run` runs the tests.

Build UI by looking at the component gallery (`/gallery`) first: add each new component or block
there so its states can be reviewed in isolation.

## Theming

This app restyles Kumo at the token level, in `src/theme.css` only. That is a deliberate departure
from `workshop-frontend`'s ban on token theming, which predates this rework. Components and blocks
use Kumo semantic tokens (`bg-kumo-canvas`, `bg-kumo-base`, `ring-kumo-line`) and never colour
literals. Wrap a Kumo component only for what tokens cannot change, such as sizes and hit targets.

- Page backdrop: `kumo-canvas`. Content card: `kumo-base`.

## Promoting to `@gadgets/ui`

Components start here. Move one to `packages/ui` once a second frontend (e.g. a gatekeeper app) needs
it, as `packages/ui/AGENTS.md` describes. Shell and layout code is expected to stay here.
